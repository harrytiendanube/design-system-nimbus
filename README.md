# ☁️ Nimbus Design System

Nimbus is an open-source Design System created by Tiendanube / Nuvesmhop’s team to empower and enhance more stories every day, with simplicity, accessibility, consistency and performance.

## 📚 Documentation

Check out our documentation site on https://tiendanube.github.io/nimbus-website/ for detailed guidelines and resources.

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as our front-end library to provide a full interactive playground for testing and building components.

## 🚀 Installation

Install `@tiendanube/components` using any package manager.

```shell
$ npm install @tiendanube/components

// or

$ yarn add @tiendanube/components
```

## 💻 Start developing

1. **Checkout `develop` branch**

   Right now we are building over `develop` branch, so that's where you should head first.

   $ git pull
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Get all dependencies installed by running
